                Hey there, I'm Giorgos, your friendly neighborhood code wrangler!
                I've got a knack for cooking up web and data-processing applications
                from scratch â€“ from the pretty Front End to the brainy Back End, and
                all the secret sauce in between. I take my coding seriously, but
                I don't take myself too seriously. I'm all about efficiency and
                quality in my code, but I promise not to bore you with tech jargon.
                I'm an easy-going, coffee-loving developer with a side of excellent
                communication skills, and a passionate flair for what I do.
            </p>
            <p>Let's chat code,
                collaborate on projects, and have a good time doing it!
            </p>
